Barath Ballot Bin.

The Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is the current process being carried on in our county. The voting process has changed so many times in order to detect the illegal votes but still there are so many illegal votes are casted. So to reduce the illegal voting we are developing an application. This helps in secured voting and also it avoids illegal voting. This online voting application provides the benefit to vote through online from anywhere within the state. This application will be merged with voterâ€˜s Aadhar card details in the database for the voting process.  
The Barath Ballot Bin application contains details of Aadhar card holders and the details of a voter. Based on the Aadhar card ID the voter will be allowed to cast his vote. During the voting process, the applicant has to give his thumb impression and retina recognition of his eyes for the purpose of verification. If the user is recognized then he will be allowed to cast vote based on this verification. If the voter has voted and tries to revote, the application will block the user in that particular page and it displays an alert message. The vote will be added in the database. Here the voter does not need a voter ID. Aadhar card is more than sufficient to cast the votes.
